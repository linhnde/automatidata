### [Identify data types and relevant variables using Python](automatidata_1_start_python.ipynb)
To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis](automatidata_2_eda.ipynb)
I use Python to show data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data, a box plot of the ride durations, and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.

### [Conduct an A/B test](automatidata_3_statistics.ipynb)
The project is reaching its midpoint. Next, I get a specific assignment: to compute descriptive statistics and conduct a hypothesis test.

### [Build a multiple linear regression model](automatidata_4_regression_analysis.ipynb)
Itâ€™s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts. We are ready to build the regression model and update the client New York City TLC about our progress.

### [Machine Learning](automatidata_5_machine_learning.ipynb)
Our client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has requested that I build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip since drivers depend on tips.
